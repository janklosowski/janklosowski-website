<p>There is this peculiar belief that somewhere between the fourteenth and twenty-first year of your life, you become adult, a fully developed human being.</p>

<p>Since today morning, Iâ€™m thirty-seven. There was not a single year when this internal transformation became any faster or significantly different. Though, Iâ€™m sure that it can slow down anytime. Thatâ€™s why the idea of this one-time transformation is so harmful.</p>

<p>I can only laugh about how childish and naive I was in my thirties. And itâ€™s a good laugh. When I go back another seven years, and another, and another, itâ€™s like diving into memories of substantially different people. Iâ€™m painfully non-religious, but this type of reincarnation is real, happening right now in our lives.</p>

<p>Not everybody feels that way. Why? I donâ€™t believe there is a single person who does not change. This creepy old man that disgusts you so much, at some point in his life was handsome and funny. Crazy, I know, but staying the same in the entirely different body would be even more strange and creepy. So why not everybody sees that change?</p>

<p>I suppose itâ€™s about identity. The critical part of what we consider ourselves bases on the concept of maturity. The idea that in the first part of your life, youâ€™re a work in progress, until you get a certain level of completeness where your childhood ends. As a child, your responsibilities are limited. Youâ€™re allowed to make mistakes, to learn and change. So you do. But it immediately gets much harder since the first time you hear: â€œDonâ€™t be a child.â€</p>

<p>My mother never softened her voice when talked to me in my early years. When I asked her â€œWhat does periphrasis mean?â€ she didnâ€™t smile. She answered. Maybe thatâ€™s why I didnâ€™t get rules of childhood â€œrightâ€ and was not stigmatized by them in a typical way. It made me an odd child and a weird adult. Or maybe I was just a tiny bit more aware of how unique and special we all are? Ready for the next seven years, and another, and whatever the lottery has to offer, I hope Iâ€™m still less grown than Iâ€™m able to be.</p>

<p>Nowadays, every month or two, I see an article about how the recent generation is less mature than their parents. How thirty-somethings behave as they were teenagers. And most importantly, where are those real men? Maybe theyâ€™re gone looking for some real women? Or perhaps they just stopped fooling themselves playing fully-developed in their twenties? I hope so. Because itâ€™s an excellent piece of advice to follow.</p>

<p>Stop being complete. You never were. Youâ€™re allowed to be in progress. Youâ€™re allowed to make mistakes. Youâ€™re allowed to change. In fact, you have no power to stop it.</p>
